# Team CRM Configuration Fix Guide

## üö® Issues Identified from Logs

Based on your deployment logs, I've identified several configuration issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Supermemory Configuration Missing
```
[WARN] No Supermemory configuration - assistant will have no memory!
```

### 2. Google Calendar API Not Configured
```
[WARN] Google Calendar API credentials not configured - calendar features will be simulated
```

### 3. Database Activity Tracking Issues
```
[ERROR] Failed to track activity {"component":"UserActivityTracker","error":"Database not initialized"}
```

### 4. Supermemory API 404 Error
```
Error searching memories: Error: HTTP 404: Not Found
```

## üîß Quick Fix Script

Run this command to analyze your current configuration:

```bash
npm run fix-config
```

This will show you exactly what's missing and provide step-by-step solutions.

## üìã Required Environment Variables for Render

Add these to your Render service environment variables:

### Essential Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=your_supermemory_key_here
SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL=https://api.supermemory.ai
```

### Database (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
```

### Team Authentication
```bash
JOE_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_joe
CHARLIE_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_charlie
TRE_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_tre
JOSH_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_josh
KYLE_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_kyle
AMANDA_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_amanda
```

### Google Calendar (Optional)
```bash
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

## üéØ Priority Actions

### 1. Fix Supermemory (High Priority)
1. Get your Supermemory API key from [https://supermemory.ai](https://supermemory.ai)
2. Add `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
3. Add `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL=https://api.supermemory.ai`

### 2. Verify OpenRouter (High Priority)
1. Check your OpenRouter API key is valid
2. Test with a simple API call if needed

### 3. Add Database (Medium Priority)
1. Create a PostgreSQL database on Render
2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` to environment variables
3. This will enable activity tracking and better persistence

### 4. Google Calendar (Low Priority)
1. Only needed if you want calendar integration
2. Can be skipped for now - system works without it

## üîç How to Add Environment Variables in Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your `team-crm` service
3. Click on "Environment" tab
4. Click "Add Environment Variable"
5. Add each variable one by one
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Redeploy your service

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After adding the environment variables:

1. **Check Supermemory**: Look for this in logs:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Supermemory initialized for assistant
   ```

2. **Check OpenRouter**: Look for successful AI processing

3. **Test the Application**:
   - Visit: `https://team-crm-26ks.onrender.com/chat`
   - Login with Joe's credentials
   - Submit a test update
   - Check if AI processing works

## üöÄ Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix:
```
[WARN] No Supermemory configuration - assistant will have no memory!
[WARN] Google Calendar API credentials not configured - calendar features will be simulated
[ERROR] Failed to track activity {"component":"UserActivityTracker","error":"Database not initialized"}
```

### After Fix:
```
[INFO] Supermemory initialized for assistant
[INFO] Context-Aware AI system initialized successfully with Supermemory
[INFO] Activity tracking enabled
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Supermemory Still Shows Warnings:
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check if the key has expired
3. Ensure `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL` is set correctly

### If Database Still Shows Errors:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. Check if the database is accessible
3. The system will work without database, but with limited features

### If OpenRouter Fails:
1. Check your API key balance
2. Verify the key is valid
3. Test with a simple API call

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. Run the diagnostic script: `npm run diagnose`
2. Check the logs in Render dashboard
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with a fresh deployment

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when you see:

1. ‚úÖ All personal assistants initialize without warnings
2. ‚úÖ Context-Aware AI system shows "initialized successfully with Supermemory"
3. ‚úÖ No database initialization errors
4. ‚úÖ AI processing works for team updates
5. ‚úÖ Executive dashboard shows processed data

**Remember**: The system is designed to be resilient. Even with some configuration issues, it will continue to work with reduced functionality. The fixes above will restore full functionality.
