## 💡 Email Processing Flow

1. **Email Received** → Assistant email handler
2. **Context Extracted** → Business entities, urgency, financial data
3. **AI Processing** → Enhanced with email context
4. **Team Update Created** → Converted to standard update format
5. **Memory Storage** → Context stored in enhanced memory
6. **Executive Check** → Escalation decision based on content
7. **Pipeline Integration** → Processed through team orchestrator

## 🧠 Context Extraction Examples

### Sample Email Context:
```javascript
{
  source: 'email',
  email: {
    from: { name: 'John Smith', address: 'john@acmecorp.com' },
    subject: 'URGENT: Implementation Timeline Concerns'
  },
  sender: {
    isKnownClient: true,
    communicationHistory: { emailCount: 12, relationship: 'client' }
  },
  urgency: {
    level: 'high',
    keywords: ['urgent', 'deadline', 'concerns'],
    hasDeadline: true
  },
  business: {
    financial: {
      amounts: [{ value: '$150,000', context: 'investment' }],
      hasFinancialContent: true
    },
    meetings: { requested: true, urgency: 'high' },
    entities: { companies: ['Acme Corp'], people: ['John Smith'] }
  }
}
```

### Extracted Business Intelligence:
- **Financial Impact**: $150,000 investment at risk
- **Urgency Level**: Critical (multiple urgency indicators)
- **Action Required**: Meeting scheduling, board presentation
- **Escalation**: Yes (high urgency + financial content + meeting request)

## 📊 Executive Summary Enhancement

### Email Escalations Section:
```
📧 EMAIL ESCALATIONS:
• 1 emails escalated to executive attention
• URGENT: Implementation Timeline Concerns

ATTENTION REQUIRED:
• Address board concerns about investment ROI (Joe Martinez)
• Resolve technical integration issues (Joe Martinez)

REVENUE IMPACT:
• $150,000 investment at risk due to timeline concerns
```

## 🔌 Integration Points

### 1. Assistant Email Handler Integration:
```javascript
// Extract email context
const emailContext = await emailContextExtractor.extractEmailContext(storedEmail, assistant);

// Process with enhanced context
const processedUpdate = await personalAssistant.processUpdate(emailContent, emailContext);

// Send to team orchestrator
await this.sendToTeamOrchestrator(emailContext, processedUpdate, assistant);
```

### 2. Team Orchestrator Integration:
```javascript
// Process email updates
async processEmailUpdate(teamUpdate, emailContext) {
    const result = await this.processTeamUpdate(teamUpdate.memberName, teamUpdate.updateText, {
        ...teamUpdate.metadata,
        emailContext,
        source: 'email'
    });
    
    // Check for executive escalation
    if (this.shouldEscalateEmail(emailContext, result)) {
        await this.escalateEmailToExecutive(emailContext, result);
    }
}
```

### 3. Master Agent Integration:
```javascript
// Handle email escalations
async receiveEscalation(escalation) {
    const escalationUpdate = {
        memberName: 'Email System',
        extracted: {
            emailEscalation: {
                from: escalation.source,
                subject: escalation.subject,
                reason: escalation.reason,
                urgency: escalation.urgency
            }
        },
        priorityScore: 50 // High priority for escalations
    };
    
    // Force summary generation
    const summary = await this.generateSummary();
}
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### Enhanced Assistant Emails Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE assistant_emails (
    -- ... existing fields ...
    processed_data JSONB,
    email_context JSONB,  -- NEW: Stores extracted context
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3, 2),
    requires_attention BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    -- ... rest of fields ...
);

-- Index for context queries
CREATE INDEX idx_assistant_emails_context 
ON assistant_emails USING gin(email_context) 
WHERE email_context IS NOT NULL;
```
